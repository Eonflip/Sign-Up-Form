# Sign-Up-Form
This is my sign-up form written in HTML and CSS. 

Some things I learned working through this project

<ul>
    <li>Form Structure</li>
    <li>Using VH + VW to order a page</li>
    <li>Using Flexbox to help keep containers organized</li>
    <li>Importing fonts and using them on the webpage</li>
</ul>

I'm excited to eventually learn to connect this to a backend system.
